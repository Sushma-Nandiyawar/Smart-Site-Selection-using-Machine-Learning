Being a largely populated country, India
struggles to evenly distribute the amenities. With this hurdle, it
is hard to invest at a location without a proper survey. This
study proposes a model that will aid the businessman in site
selection. The suitability analysis is done through the Analytic
Hierarchy Process(AHP) model using various factors. The unit
of study is a commercial business and taking a fashion point, a
food joint and a grocery store as an example, we have come up
with a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict the rating of
the site based on profitability.
